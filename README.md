# Phobos 1.7.2 Clean Buildable Source (all phobos boys are literally giving me so much attention) "ur 12" xdd so cool comebacks omg get a life you no lifers 

This source has been checked by two people, myself and a friend. My friend did not find anything as he briefly went through the files. I have scanned and gone through every file and lib to make sure it's clean. This is **safe to use.**

## Opening the ClickGUI:

**There is no default bind, you can do .bind clickgui key to bind it and it will work.** 

So what I've heard so far? Apparently this one got leaked by plivid but who cares lel. Enjoy this share. xd

## Running in a Dev Environment:
```gradle
gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
gradlew runClient
```

## Compiling the client:
```gradle
gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
gradlew build
```
You will find your built jar in the directory `builds/libs`. 

## Cosmetics; Adding them to yourself:
- Go to `managers/CosmeticsManager.java`
```java
        this.cosmeticsUserMap.put("YOUR-DASHED-UUID-HERE", Arrays.asList(new ModelBase[]{Cosmetics.INSTANCE.cloutGoggles}));
```
Then compile the client. - **There are also other options like squidLauncher and SantaHatModel as well, which you can find the file.** 

## Too lazy to build the jar yourself?
